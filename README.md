# odin-landing-page

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).
It is a generic landing page for a business, based on a given design image.
The focus right now is to make sure it looks good on a large device.
Later on it will be updated to be more responsive and look nicer on mobile.
CSS flexbox was the primary tool used to layout the page.
